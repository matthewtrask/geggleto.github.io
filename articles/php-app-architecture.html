                <h2>Application Architecture</h2>

                <h3>Part One: Software Packages</h3>
                <p>
                In this article we are going to cover application architecture. I have found that both are an ever evolving concept, as more libraries are created your architecture and folder structure will change. Currently and for the foreseeable future I have been rolling with what is currently in this document.<br/>
                <br/>
                First off lets identify a few design goals.<br/>
                    <br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Our applications must be testable.<br/>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Our applications must be modify-able.<br/>
                    <br/>
                Sounds easy right? I am sure we all start off new projects thinking that things will be perfect. Well I hope these ideas help you actually keep those design goals. All too often with deadlines and budget concerns that you end up with a less ideal system because time didn't allow for proper design to happen. We all have been there, or are currently there.<br/>
                    <br/>
                Let's talk about what tools I use day-in-day out to complete jobs.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>Frameworks: Slim Framework</h3>
<p>
                I swear by the slim framework. I contribute often to that project. The reason why, it has the perfect number of features for me. It doesn't have too little, it doesn't have too much. It's literally the perfect little starter package.<br/>
    <br/>
                It provides Routing and Dispatching. It stays out of my way and lets me develop how I need to &lt; Adaptive &gt;.<br/>
    <br/>
                When I say adaptively, I mean that it provides a perfect slate for creating business logic. Slim literally has nothing to do with it. There are no conventions, nothing that I need to integrate into Slim. This leaves me with an easy and clean API into my Service Layer.
</p>
                <br />
                <h3>Services, build upon Services.</h3>
                <p>
                When people talk about Services it sometimes gets lost that this is where the business logic is. You might think that this is some crazy class calling chain that does magic stuff...<br/>
                My Services aggregate information from the Persistence Layer or are a Utility.<br/>
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>Utility</h3>
<p>
                I call a service that does not interact with a the persistence layer a Utility. For instance I have an Email Utility that uses SwiftMailer to send an email. No persistence Interaction there at all. It merely provides an API to send an email.
</p>
                <br />
                <h3>Persistence Layer</h3>
<p>
                Simply put, I use Active Record. I have never needed anything else. I don't work with 100 servers, my project's are not data intensive. Only a few GB's a day. Active Record is perfectly fine 99% of the time.
                I love its simplicity. I love how in 20 lines of code I never have to write a SQL statement unless I absolutely need to. I like how I don't have to use relationships, and I love how they work.
                I understand that it's not the most PURE architecture. Yes it does violate the SRP principle, and you know what? I don't care. It's not my code to maintain, I leave the downsides up to the author's.
                <br /> If you are wondering what one I use ... 'Eloquent' <i>ducks</i>.
</p>
<br />
<br />
                <h3>Part Two: Design - The pieces fit together</h3>
                <p>
                    What I really have neglected thus far is the reasoning for all of these different components. All of these components fit together like layers of an onion.
                    I always 100% maintain the following rule and it is so absolutely necessary.<br />

                    <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;RULE #1: Layers Only communicate Up ONE layer, DOWN ONE layer or SIDEWAYS.</strong><br />

                    <br />Did I lose you? Hang on a bit more.<br />
                    <br />
                    Let's talk about these layers. It's quite simple really.<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>TOP LAYER</strong> Slim Framework<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>MIDDLE LAYER</strong> Services / Utilities<br />
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>BOTTOM LAYER</strong> Active Record [Eloquent for me]<br />
                    <br />

                    So this is the reason why My Rule #1 is so important. <br />
                    Slim is my front-end, its the most top layer. It handles turning System Input into requests for my system to pass down and process.
                    Slim only EVER, communicates with the service layer, NEVER EVER EVER does it interact with models.<br />
                    This is the slippery slope,We all have been here. Ugh I just need the model, I already have the PK ill just grab it here. <br />
                    <pre><code class="PHP">function ($req, $res, $args) {
    $model = Model::find($args['id']);
}</code></pre>
                <strong>DON'T DO IT!!!!!!!</strong> <br />
                You in 5 years will be super glad that you don't. Consider these 2 things. <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) It breaks DRY. <br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Migration <br />
                You want to move your backend from Eloquent 5 -> 6. The API is BC breaking. <br />
                You now have to go through your entire APP to replace all instances of Model::find() to whatever the new API... trust me its a headache.<br />
                Just don't do it. I know its a pain to write YET ANOTHER SERVICE [YAS]. Future you will be so thankful.<br />
                <br/>
                <br />
                Having all of the code separated out into its own compartments make your system extremely adaptable. Need a new Business Entity?
                Simply make your 3 base classes [ Controller , Service, Model ]. By using inheritance you can have a basic CRUD API setup in 5 minutes. <br />
                Add a simple AJAX Front-End and have it working with-in an hour. Add business logic and validation as needed.<br />
                </p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    Throughout this article I have explain how I operate and solve problems. There are always more than one good solution to a problem.
                    You might be limited in the technologies you can use at work, but that is not a reason to practice bad programming habits. In whatever
                    situation you find yourself, keep the core ideals I have hopefully explained in mind. <br />
                    Building Layered software will greatly improve your productivity and make the software you develop higher quality and more marketable.
                    Complex systems can and should always be broken down into at minimum these layers in your design. <br />
                    <br />
                    I hope you found this article informative<br />
                    Happy Coding! <br />
